Set up a map of prices for a number of gizmos that you covet. Then produce
a second map with the same keys and the prices at a 10 percent discount.
2. Write a program that reads words from a file. Use a mutable map to count
how often each word appears. To read the words, simply use a java.util.Scanner :
val in = new java.util.Scanner(java.io.File("myfile.txt"))
while (in.hasNext()) process in.next()
Or look at Chapter 9 for a Scalaesque way.
At the end, print out all words and their counts.
3. Repeat the preceding exercise with an immutable map.
4. Repeat the preceding exercise with a sorted map, so that the words are
printed in sorted order.Exercises
5. Repeat the preceding exercise with a java.util.TreeMap that you adapt to the
Scala API.
6. Define a linked hash map that maps "Monday"
